Postmortem

My first postmortem

Issue Summary

Duration: A nerve-wracking span of 120 minutes, spanning from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM WAT (West African Time).

Impact: Patrons of our cherished e-commerce platform encountered exasperatingly tardy page loading and an unfortunate subset of shoppers faced the frustration of incomplete purchases during the service disruption. Nearly 20% of users were ensnared in this unfortunate occurrence - an ordeal of significant magnitude.

Underlying Cause: Regrettably, the trigger for this upheaval was a surge in incoming traffic that inundated our web application servers, causing sluggish responsiveness and leading to certain requests succumbing to timeouts. This incident has underscored the realization that even the most robust of servers can bow before the capricious forces of online shopping.

Timeline
•	10:00 AM: Our monitoring system lit up with alerts, signaling a significant surge of incoming traffic to our website. "Looks like we're in for an eventful day!" we remarked.
•	10:05 AM: A vigilant member of our alert engineering team noticed the website's responsiveness crawling at the pace of a sloth on a leisurely Sunday morning. The observation was swiftly communicated to the rest of the team, leaving us astonished - our cherished website, the pride of our digital domain, had fallen victim to the online shopping frenzy.
•	10:10 AM: Our initial suspicions gravitated towards the load balancers, and we commenced our investigation in that realm. "It must be those pesky load balancers," we muttered with a mix of frustration and determination.
•	10:30 AM: The load balancers were subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing, prompting us to shift our focus to the web application servers. "Well, that theory's out the window," we sighed in tandem.
•	11:00 AM: The revelation dawned that the influx of traffic had generated a bottleneck within the web application servers. "Aha! We've caught you, you elusive bottleneck," we exclaimed triumphantly.
•	11:15 AM: Our attempts to expand the fleet of web application servers proved futile, as the issue persisted stubbornly. "Come on, servers, don't let us down now!" we implored with a hint of desperation.
•	11:30 AM: In a move of strategic escalation, we summoned the expertise of our DevOps team - the stalwart heroes of such digital dilemmas. "We need you more than ever, DevOps team!" we vocalized with a sense of urgency.
•	12:00 PM: The resolution finally arrived when our DevOps team unearthed and resolved a misconfiguration in the server settings, the very culprit behind the bottleneck. it's a miracle!" we exulted with a mix of relief and jubilation.Root Cause and Resolution

The primary reason for the problem was a sudden surge in traffic that led to the web application servers being overloaded, resulting in delayed response times and a few requests experiencing timeouts. The DevOps team successfully resolved the problem by identifying and rectifying a misconfiguration in the server settings that was causing the bottleneck. This incident also underscored the valuable lesson that uncomplicated solutions can often be remarkably efficient - a realization that was unexpected.Corrective and Preventative Measures

To fortify against potential future mishaps, we're armed with a handful of strategic measures:
•	Amplify the capacity of our web application servers to preemptively handle surges in traffic. Preparedness is our watchword!
•	Infuse our systems with heightened surveillance and vigilant alerts to promptly detect any lurking bottlenecks. "Bottlenecks, you're under our vigilant gaze!"
•	Embark on regular load testing endeavors to unearth and tackle latent performance glitches before they encroach on user experiences. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!"
•	Craft and enact a more resilient disaster recovery blueprint, meticulously designed to curtail the impact of potential future downtimes. "We're leaving no room for chance!"

Tasks to Tackle the Concern:
	Pore over and fine-tune server configurations to shield against akin setup quandaries in subsequent occurrences. "Our servers will serenade like melodious birds!"
	Put in place an automated scaling mechanism for web application servers, ensuring a seamless adjustment to traffic fluctuations. "While we might have considered hiring a battalion of interns to frantically spin up servers on demand, it appears that modern work culture frowns upon such endeavors. Hence, we'll opt for the prudent path of implementing automated scaling like the responsible adults we are."
	Introduce supplementary monitoring and alert systems for web application server performance. "Our current monitoring setup is akin to a screen door on a submarine—largely ineffective. We're craving alerts more voraciously than a teenager's phone during a relationship tiff."
	Execute periodic load testing to guarantee robust performance even under the duress of soaring traffic volumes. "We're committed to fortifying our application's strength as if it were forged from the resilient heart of a Banded Iron Formation."
